# Machine_Leraning
This is all about diffrent Machine Learning Algorithms:
1) Supervised 
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Trees
 - Random Forest 
 - Naive Bayes
 - KNearest Neighbour
 - Support Vector Machine
 
2) Unsupervised
 - KMean Clusterring
 
3) Regularization
 - L1 Regularization(Lasso Regression)
 - L2 Regularization(Ridge Regression)

4) Feature Extracion
  - PCA(Principal Component Analysis)

5) Model Selection
 - KFold Cross Validation
 - GridSearch 
 - RandomizedSearch
